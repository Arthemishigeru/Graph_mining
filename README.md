# Graph_mining

This project done in group of two aimed to compute graph clustering algorithm and other graph algorithms on a dataset which was not built to be represented by graphs.

with my teamate we chose to represent the laws voted by the European parliament between 2010 and 2014 by a bipartite graph to see if we could find the European parties. It was quite successful and emphasizes some specificities of the European parliament which is  made of compromises and agreements.
